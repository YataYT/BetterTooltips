This mod adds a lot more shine to tooltips when you hover over them, featuring shaders, particles, and glow. Lower rarities get minimal changes, while higher rarities get more and more visuals.

Features:
- Customized effects for each rarity, including customized particles
- Config options for controlling particle rate and toggling glow
- Effect appears on the text from picked up and fished items, and mouseover text
- Custom Calamity rarities
